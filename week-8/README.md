<h2>Project Description:</h2>

This project is a product landing page for the physical editions of Rosalia's LUX album. In its entirety, the page is designed to mimic the album's visual style and content while promoting the product to visitors. 


<h2>CSS Transformations:</h2>

For my CSS transformations, I chose to apply a simple Y-axis transform to the BUY NOW buttons on the shop page and to the submit button on my form. I wanted to make transformations straightforward, given the other various effects on my page.


<h2>CSS Animations:</h2>
For my CSS Animations, I applied a subtle scroll fade-in effect to the main content of my page. I chose to do this to make the header and nav bar the primary focus when a user opens the page. Beforehand, the quote beneath these elements was slightly distracting due to its contrast with the other elements. In general, it also provides a subtle, nice effect that fits the page's visual themes.

You may also notice a slight fade in when the page first loads, which helps soften that sharp transition between states. For this, I used a combo of CSS and an inline HTML script from this website:

<h2>Other Effects:</h2>

Using AI, I added a few Java elements, including a slight glow that follows the mouse and a language switcher that appears when the user hovers over nav links. While doing this, I asked AI to explain how it was applying these effects in Java to start getting a better understanding of the code it was writing.


<h2>Table Content:</h2>

Instead of implementing the table elsewhere on my page, I chose to make my product cards a table themselves. I did this to meet the requirement and to see/experiment firsthand with how a table would stack vertically on mobile. 


<h2>Challenges and Solutions:</h2>

My main challenge with this website was making everything mobile-responsive. I really struggle to make things fit well on mobile in general and get easily overwhelmed by flexbox and media queries. To make things perfectly responsive, it would probably take another week of consistent work and understanding. I really just dislike designing for mobile in general, as it feels so limiting and constraining for my visual designs. 

In addition, I also really struggled with the nav bar! I could not for the life of me figure out why it was not sticking to the top of the page until I realized I had placed it within my <header> tags and it was being constricted by my hero image. 

<h2>Key Learnings:</h2>

Through this project, I felt like I learned a little more about how media queries work, even though my responsiveness is sort of messy. I realized that there isn't much needed to make things responsive until you need to tweak spacing, sizing, and other things. I also learned more about creating and refining animations. Transforms and animations are actually really fun to play around with when you understand their individual parts! Lastly, I learned a bit about how Java works and how to combine it with CSS to create interesting effects. While I don't think I can write Java confidently yet, I am starting to understand how to link it to elements in your HTML and CSS style cascades.
