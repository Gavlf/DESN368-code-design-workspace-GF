        <h2>Gear Up, Angler!</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Before embarking on any serious expedition, a seasoned angler must ensure their kit is in order. We'll review the essential tools and tackle needed to brave the summer waters, from the trusty rod to tantalizing bait.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Flimsy Rod: </span>A primitive tool, crafted from mere sticks. While suitable for ponds and practice, it is prone to breaking and will surely fail you when battling a true river titan.</li>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Fishing Rod: </span>Your durable and reliable workhorse. This standard-issue rod is the essential tool for all common angling and should be your primary objective to craft or acquire.</li>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">Manila Clams: </span>The secret weapon of the wise explorer. Do not wait for opportunity; create it. Hunt for these clams on the beach, craft them into Fish Bait, and use this potent lure to summon aquatic life to any location at will.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>Tip: You will need a crafting bench to craft these items!</code></pre>

      <section id="beginners-bite">
        <h2>The Beginner's Bite</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Master the art of the catch on the ocean's most common inhabitants and the river's smallest fry. This foundational practice is essential for honing your technique and patience. Conquering these simple tugs on the line will lead to bigger pulls later.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Sea Bass: </span> You will become intimately familiar with this large-shadowed specimen. It is notoriously common in the sea at all hours and serves as the ultimate test of an angler's patience. Do not be discouraged; use its reliable bite to perfect your timing.
</li>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Horse Mackerel: </span> A small, cooperative, and ever-present catch in the ocean. Its tiny, darting shadow provides excellent practice for quick reflexes.</li>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Tadpole: </span> This tiny, flickering shadow is a common sight in the freshwater ponds during the summer. Use this easy catch to master your casting aim in smaller spaces.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>Tip: You only need to press the A button once to reel in.</code></pre>

        <h2>The A+ Listers</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>You've learned the ropes by catching the 'C+' students of the sea. It is now time to pursue the true 'A+' Listers. This section is dedicated to the rare, high-value, and challenging specimens that will truly test your angling mastery.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Great White Shark:</span> The king of the ocean predators. This massive, finned shadow is a rare sight in the summer sea, and landing one is a true test of an angler's nerve—with a massive Bell reward to match.</li>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Mahi-Mahi:</span> A brilliantly colored trophy found exclusively at the pier. Its large, fast-moving shadow and electric-yellow-and-blue body make it one of the most sought-after prizes of the summer.</li>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Dorado:</span> This golden "river dolphin" is a high-value, large-shadowed fish found only in your island's rivers. Known for its spectacular leaping, it's a prized catch for any freshwater angler looking for a challenge.</li>
        </ul>
         <pre><code>Tip: Sharks will have a small fin in their shadow.</code></pre>

        <p>The natural world operates on its own precise rhythms, and mastering them is key to a bountiful haul. Discover the optimal times of day and specific weather conditions that bring forth the most elusive and sought-after summer catches.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Great White Shark:</span> This finned leviathan hunts primarily at night and in the morning (4 PM – 9 AM), appearing in any weather, but only in the open sea.</li>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Mahi-Mahi:</span> A 24-hour trophy that can be found in sun or rain, but you must focus your search exclusively by casting off the wooden pier.</li>
          <li><span class="bullet-header">The Dorado:</span> This golden river giant is a daytime creature (4 AM – 9 PM), appearing in all weather, and can only be found in your island's river system.</li>
