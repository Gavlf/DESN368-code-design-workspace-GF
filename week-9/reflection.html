        <h2>THE THRESHOLD</h2>
        <p class="question">What was the specific moment this quarter where code clicked for you?</p>
        <p>A specific moment this quarter when code clicked for me was when I was building my product landing page. While working on this project, I quickly established a basic structure and had a much easier time building and formatting the content in CSS than before. Debugging was much less intense this time, as I was able to overcome the obstacles I encountered during my field guide project with my experience.</p>
        <h2>THE PIT</h2>
        <p class="question">What was the hardest assignment? How did you get yourself out of the "pit of despair"?</p>
        <p>The most challenging assignment this quarter for me was actually my portfolio site! I was on a time crunch and relied on AI assistance to quickly debug issues. I would have liked to put more time into responsive design and overall visuals to showcase my experience better. My product landing page excelled further in visuals by far.</p>
        <h2>THE PIVOT</h2>
        <p class="question"> Look at your original "Moodz and Vibes." How does your final portfolio compare? Did you stick to the plan or pivot? Why?</p>
        <p>I pivoted from my original moodz and vibes design because it didn’t reflect my design style. When I originally designed it, I was simply trying to get the assignment done in time. My portfolio site better matches my design style, even though I haven't had as much time to put into the visuals. This is because I prefer high-contrast, minimalist, and sleek designs.</p>
        <h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
        <p class="question">What would you change about how you approached this course? (e.g., time management, reading documentation, asking for help).</p>
        <p >I would mostly change my time management approach for this course. If I had invested more time in semantic HTML and responsive design, I would have a slightly better grasp of code. Taking my time with media queries specifically and code organization would make my work much more stable overall.</p>
        <h2>THE FUTURE</h2>
        <p class="question">How do you see this hybrid skillset (Design + Code) impacting your future practice?</p>
        <p>I think that the hybrid skillset I have begun to develop in this class will greatly impact my future practice. Learning to integrate AI assistance to help me get closer to my design visions in this course is already a considerable step in adapting to the changing landscape of web design as a whole. Moving forward, I can see how continuing to grow this skillset will help prepare me for success in the job market, both in and out of coding positions. This is because the AI side of this skillset, in particular, can apply to other roles within design careers.
