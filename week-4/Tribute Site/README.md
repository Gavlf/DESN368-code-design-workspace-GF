## Reflection

**What was the hardest part of translating your design to code?** <br>
I would say the hardest part of translating my design to html and css was getting the spacing right using the elements of the box model. It took a lot of experimenting with pixel amounts and flipping back and forth between my code and the preview to make sure the spacing fit my figma design.

**What CSS property/concept do you feel you understand better now?** <br>
I feel like I better understand how to use selectors and semantic html elements to divide a page into parts that can be easily edited with css.

**How closely does your code match your design? What would you do differently?** <br>
I think my code matches pretty closely to my design. I would like to add an inner shadow on the image like in my figma file, however, I don't really notice a huge difference without it. I did struggle with trying to figure out the weight of fonts specifically as the units are completely different when working with html.
